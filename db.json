Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9.

Which means it's missing many of the optimizations that are in the final build, like dead code elimination.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the build process to run Closure on the non-minified production builds, too, by moving the sourcemap generation to later in the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe non-minified builds will still preserve the original symbol names, and we'll use Prettier to add back whitespace. This is the exact same approach we've been using for years to generate production builds for Meta.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the only difference between the minified and non- minified builds is whitespace and symbol mangling. The semantic structure of the program should be identical.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, I disabled symbol mangling when running Closure compiler. Then, in a later step, the symbols are mangled by Terser. This is when the source maps are generated.",

To help avoid precompiled or inlined JSX having subtle breakages or deopting hidden classes, I renamed the symbol so that we can early error if private implementation details are used or mismatching versions are used.\r\n\r\nWhy \"transitional\"? Well, because this is not the last time we'll change the shape. This is just a stepping stone to removing the `ref` field on the elements in the next version so we'll likely have to do it again.\r\n",
